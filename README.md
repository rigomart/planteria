## Planteria

**Planteria** is an AI-powered planning tool designed to help **solo builders** quickly turn fuzzy ideas into clear, shippable plans. It treats plans as structured data—moving from **ideas → outcomes → deliverables → actions**—with strict guardrails to ensure clarity, demoability, and focus on the minimum shippable path.

The tool emphasizes:

* **Simplicity first**: No technical specs, no UI design, no overcomplexity.
* **Fast value**: Users go from idea to validated plan in minutes.
* **Structured editing**: Supports both node-level (rename, split/merge, move, prune) and plan-level operations (rescope, reprioritize, audit).
* **Guardrails**: Enforces validity rules (e.g., outcomes capped at 7, deliverables at 9 each, actions at 7 each, no orphaned items, demoable `doneWhen` statements).
* **Phased growth**: Starts lean with auto-accepted edits and no integrations, then gradually adds exports, MCP agent access, approval workflows, grounding with evidence, and eventually branching/advanced prioritization.

At its core, Planteria is about **maximizing user speed and clarity** while keeping complexity low, with AI acting as a copilot for structured planning.
